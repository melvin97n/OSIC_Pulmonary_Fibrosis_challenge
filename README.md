# OSIC_Pulmonary_Fibrosis_challenge
A competition hosted by Kaggle, which provides tabular data and CT scans  so as to predict lung function. Feel free to check out the challange at https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression . I found this to be extremely interesting and learnt a lot during this challenge. Attached is the notebook which contains a guide I wrote based on what I learnt.
A few models were tried and the notebook contains the links to all of them.
